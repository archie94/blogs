This blog comes out of a need to document my own steps in development. Please note I am no professional( well not now anyways) and informations in this blog are completely my experience in solving particular problem. So just like all the clever Open Source licenses out there I am going to declare that I do not take any liabilities of the information(s) provided. What I can guarantee is that the situation(s) or material(s) are documented as it occurred to me.

If you wish to contact me for any information(s), correction(s) or anything else feel free to drop a mail at [arkaprava94@gmail.com](mailto:arkaprava94@gmail.com)
