Here I plan to keep links of exciting blog posts which I encounter. I will go on updating the list regularly. 

1. A small and comprehensive [blog](https://johnleach.co.uk/words/323/git-submodules-in-n-easy-steps) about getting acquainted with submodules in git. 

2. Often an android device does not show up in ubuntu even though ADB has been enabled on the phone. The trick is to add your device to `udev` rules. Here is a good [tutorial](http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/android/339-android-oneplustwo-oneplusx-enable-adb-mtp-detection-ubuntu-trusty) to do that. Alternatively go through the [developer](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html) page. 

3. [Add color to text in python](http://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/)

4. [Merging vs Rebasing in git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)
